# Simon-game
The Simon Game is a popular electronic memory game that has captivated players of all ages since its introduction. This report aims to provide an overview of the game, its history, gameplay mechanics, and its impact on players.
The Simon Game is a simple yet challenging memory-based game. The game consists of a small electronic device with four buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. The device produces a sequence of lights and sounds that the player must memorize and reproduce accurately. The game starts with a single light and sound, and with each successful round, the sequence lengthens, becoming progressively more difficult.
The main objective of the Simon Game is to remember and repeat the ever-increasing sequence of lights and sounds. Players must pay close attention to the order in which the buttons light up and produce sounds, as they need to replicate the exact sequence without making any mistakes. A single wrong move results in the game ending, and players have to start again from the beginning.
